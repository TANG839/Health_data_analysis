In this project, I worked with various data analysis tools, including SQL, Power BI, and Excel, 
to derive insights from the dataset [ocd_patient_dataset.csv](https://github.com/TANG839/Health_data_analysis/files/13717779/ocd_patient_dataset.csv)
 which I obtained from Kaggle.
 
 Firstly, in SQL, I broke down the analysis into 5 stages. On the first stage, I calculated the 
 total number of male and female patients and the average 'Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions)' 
 for each gender. On the second stage, I counted the number of patients for each ethnicity and 
 computed the average 'Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions)' for each ethnicity. On the third stage, I 
 grouped patients by the month of their OCD diagnosis and counts the number of patients diagnosed 
 in each month. On the forth stage,I identified the most common types of obsessions among patients 
 and calculated the average 'Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions)' for each obsession type. On the last step, 
 I identified the most common types of compulsions among patients and calculated the average 
 'Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions)' for each compulsion type.[Uploading Health data analysis.sqlâ€¦]()


 
 Secondly, I imported five datasets obtained in SQL into Power BI and made five graphs to visualize 
 the five stages of analysis in SQL.
 
 Finally, I made five graphs in Excel to illustrate the five datasets to finalize the analysis.[Health data analysis.xlsx](https://github.com/TANG839/Health_data_analysis/files/13721293/Health.data.analysis.xlsx)

 
 SQL helped me manipulate the data and perform some feature engineering. Excel and Power BI assisted 
 me in visualizing my findings in a way that is easy for stakeholders to consume.
