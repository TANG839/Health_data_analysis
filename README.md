In this project, I worked with various data analysis tools, including SQL, Power BI, and Excel, 
to derive insights from the dataset [ocd_patient_dataset.csv](https://github.com/TANG839/Health_data_analysis/files/13717779/ocd_patient_dataset.csv)
 which I obtained from Kaggle.
 Firstly, in SQL, I broke down the analysis into 5 stages. On the first stage, I calculates the total number of male and female patients. 
 will help us manipulate the data and perform some feature engineering.
